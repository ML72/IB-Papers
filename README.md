# IB-Papers

I'm an Interlake High School class of 2022 student who took the May 2021 IB exams. Here are all the major drafts of my IB papers for anyone who is interested. Hope it helps!

For anybody wondering about my scores, I got a 40 with the following breakdown:
* English Language and Literature HL (6/7)
* Spanish B SL (7/7)
* History of the Americas SL (6/7)
* Physics HL (7/7)
* Math Analysis and Approaches HL (7/7)
* Chemistry SL (5/7)
* TOK/EE (2/3; TOK = A & EE = C)

So... This means my chemistry IA and extended essay are not the most well written and you shouldn't use my work for those as an exemplar. However, in my defense, I took chemistry year 1 and barely got instruction about how to write a good IA because COVID came just as we started (I also blame my suboptimal EE score on choosing a well-examined topic that didn't have much potential for "new" discoveries). Everything else should be decent though :)
